## Temporal Stability Crisis Decision Tree

**Purpose:** Determine intervention urgency based on Tstab (Temporal Stability Index)

### Step 1: Calculate Tstab

```
Tstab = [f × A × (1 - |δ|)] / normalization_constant

Where:
  f = Frequency (cycles per month)
      Count peaks in 30-day time series
  
  A = Amplitude (average swing, 0-10 scale)
      Average distance from mean to peaks/valleys
  
  δ = Damping coefficient
      Compare early amplitude to late amplitude
      δ < 0: Stabilizing (oscillations shrinking)
      δ = 0: Neutral (oscillations constant)
      δ > 0: Destabilizing (oscillations growing)

Normalization: Typical calibration = 100
Tstab = MIN(RAW_score / 100, 1.0)
```

### Step 2: Apply Decision Tree

## Abuse Detection & Intervention Decision Tree

**Purpose:** Systematic detection and response to abuse, exploitation, and coercive control

### Step 1: Screen for Abuse Factors

```
FOR EACH SYSTEM, ASSESS:

1. HERS (Harmful Exit Restriction Score, 0-10)
   "Can members genuinely leave without catastrophic consequences?"
   └─ Economic barriers (income dependence, asset entanglement)
   └─ Social barriers (isolation, network overlap)
   └─ Physical barriers (geography, health, custody)
   └─ Emotional barriers (low self-esteem, fear, trauma bonds)

2. ADR (Abuse Density Ratio, 0-10)
   "How frequently do harmful incidents occur?"
   └─ Count incidents per month (physical, verbal, emotional, financial, sexual)
   └─ Normalize to 0-10 scale

3. EFI (Enforcement Intensity, 0-10)
   "How often is punishment used to enforce compliance?"
   └─ Count punishment events per month
   └─ Weight by severity (mild, moderate, severe)

4. Severity (Abuse Severity Score, 0-10)
   "What is the worst-case abuse that has occurred?"
   └─ 0-2: Verbal criticism, minor conflict
   └─ 3-5: Yelling, property damage, intimidation
   └─ 6-8: Physical assault, threats, severe control
   └─ 9-10: Life-threatening violence, severe injury, rape

5. Prevalence (Abuse Prevalence, 0-10)
   "What proportion of system members are affected?"
   └─ (# affected / total members) × 10

6. CI (Consent Integrity, 0-1)
   "Is membership genuinely voluntary?"
   └─ 0 = Trapped (no genuine exit option)
   └─ 1 = Free (can leave without catastrophic consequences)

CALCULATE ABUSE SCORE:
Abuse = [(HERS + ADR + EFI + Severity + Prevalence) / 5] × (1 - CI)
```

### Step 2: Apply Abuse Decision Tree

```
IF Severity ≥ 7.0 (Life-threatening violence) THEN
│
├─ STATUS: EMERGENCY - IMMEDIATE SAFETY RISK

│  ├─ Medical attention:
│  │  ├─ Emergency room if injuries present
│  │  ├─ Document injuries medically
│  │  └─ STI testing if sexual violence
│  │
│  └─ Therapist role:
│     ├─ Mandatory reporting (if children involved or mandated reporter)
│     ├─ Safety planning (collaborative, client-led)
│     ├─ Do NOT recommend couples therapy (dangerous in active abuse)
│     ├─ Individual therapy only until safety established
│     └─ Referral to specialized domestic violence services
│
└─ DO NOT proceed with standard assessment
   Abuse overrides all other considerations

ELSE IF Abuse ≥ 5.0 (High abuse score) THEN
│
├─ STATUS: SEVERE ABUSE PATTERN DETECTED
│
├─ CRITERIA:
│  ├─ High frequency (ADR ≥ 7) AND/OR
│  ├─ Severe incidents (Severity 6-8) AND/OR
│  ├─ Widespread (Prevalence ≥ 50%) AND/OR
│  ├─ Extreme entrapment (HERS ≥ 8, CI ≤ 0.3)
│
├─ ACTION REQUIRED (within 1 week):
│  ├─ Individual assessment:

│  │  ├─ Comprehensive HERS audit (all 4 domains)
│  │  ├─ Lethality assessment (DVSI or equivalent)
│  │  ├─ Safety planning (collaborative)
│  │  └─ Referral to domestic violence specialist

│     ├─ Social: Rebuild support network outside abusive system
│     ├─ Physical: Safe housing, relocation assistance
│     ├─ Emotional: Trauma therapy, self-esteem rebuilding
│     └─ Legal: Divorce/custody planning, protection orders
│
└─ EXPECTED OUTCOME:
   ├─ Safety established: Continue individual work on exit/recovery
   ├─ Safety not established: Escalate to crisis intervention
   └─ Perpetrator refuses treatment: Victim exit strongly encouraged

ELSE IF Abuse ≥ 3.0 (Moderate abuse score) THEN
│
├─ STATUS: ABUSE PATTERN EMERGING OR EPISODIC
│
├─ ACTION REQUIRED (within 2-4 weeks):
│  ├─ Detailed abuse assessment
│  ├─ Decision point: Can couples therapy proceed safely?
│  │  ├─ YES if: Both acknowledge problem, perpetrator takes responsibility,
│  │  │         victim feels safe, CI ≥ 0.6, situation-specific abuse
│  │  │
│  │  └─ NO if: Coercive control pattern, victim fear, perpetrator denial,
│  │            CI < 0.6, any physical violence in last 6 months
│  │
│  └─ If safe: Couples therapy with ground rules and monthly monitoring
│     If unsafe: Individual therapy for both (separate therapists)
│
└─ EXPECTED OUTCOME:
   ├─ With intervention: 50-60% reduce abuse to acceptable levels
   └─ Without intervention: 70% escalate to severe pattern

ELSE (Abuse < 3.0 AND CI ≥ 0.6)
│
├─ STATUS: NO SIGNIFICANT ABUSE DETECTED
│
└─ ACTION REQUIRED:
   └─ Standard couples/organizational therapy
      Focus on positive factors (IAE, CA, RA, etc.)
      Annual abuse screening

END

## Couples Therapy Decision Tree

### Step 1: Calculate Ω_micro + Key Constructs

```
1. Calculate Ω_micro:
   Ω = Positive / (Entropy × 1.0 + Abuse × 0.5)

2. Calculate supporting metrics:
   Tstab = Temporal Stability Index
   Π_A = Individual Coherence (Partner A)
   Π_B = Individual Coherence (Partner B)
```

### Step 2: Apply Couples Decision Tree

```
IF Ω < 3.0 (Collapse imminent) THEN
│
├─ PROGNOSIS: POOR - Breakup likely without major intervention
├─ THERAPY EFFECTIVENESS: LIMITED (20-30% success rate)
│
├─ Check for abuse/entrapment:
│  └─ If Abuse ≥ 3.0 OR CI < 0.6: Recommend separation / individual therapy
│
└─ If both motivated + no abuse:
   └─ Intensive couples therapy (last-ditch effort)
      2x per week minimum, 3-month trial
      Re-assess monthly; if no improvement by month 2, recommend separation

ELSE IF 3.0 ≤ Ω < 5.0 (At risk - narrow window) THEN
│
├─ PROGNOSIS: GUARDED - Intervention window open
├─ THERAPY EFFECTIVENESS: MODERATE (50-60% success rate)
│
├─ Target lowest-scoring constructs:
│  ├─ High Entropy (Smeso, Smicro > 6.0)? → Communication skills training
│  ├─ Low Positive (IAE, CA, RA < 4.0)? → Problem-solving skills training
│  ├─ Low RA (< 4.0)? → Repair and resilience building
│  ├─ Low Π in one partner (< 5.0)? → Individual + couples therapy combined
│  └─ Low Tstab (< 0.5)? → Volatility reduction (emotion regulation)
│
└─ Weekly sessions, 6-12 months expected
   Goal: Ω ≥ 5.0 by month 6

ELSE IF 5.0 ≤ Ω < 6.0 (Viable but stressed) THEN
│
├─ PROGNOSIS: FAIR TO GOOD - Relationship viable
├─ THERAPY EFFECTIVENESS: HIGH (70-80% success rate)
│
├─ Stress management + relationship enhancement
│
└─ Bi-weekly or monthly sessions, 3-6 months
   Goal: Ω ≥ 6.0 by month 6

ELSE (Ω ≥ 6.0) (Thriving) THEN
│
├─ PROGNOSIS: EXCELLENT - Relationship stable and healthy
│
├─ Enhancement focus (not crisis management):
│  ├─ Deepen intimacy and connection
│  ├─ Build for future challenges
│  └─ Preventive maintenance
│
└─ Monthly or quarterly sessions
   Maintain Ω ≥ 6.0 indefinitely

END
```

## Organizational Intervention Decision Tree

### Step 1: Calculate Ω + Key Constructs

```
1. Calculate Ω (standard scale, N ≥ 50)
2. Key organizational constructs:
   CA_gen + CA_comp, Smacro, ADR + EFI,
   Π_leader, ρ, Tstab, dX/d
```

### Step 2: Apply Organizational Decision Tree

```
IF Ω < 2.5 (Collapse imminent) THEN
│
├─ STATUS: EMERGENCY - Organization failing
├─ TIMEFRAME: 3-12 months until bankruptcy/shutdown
│
├─ Emergency response:
│  ├─ Leadership: Emergency board meeting, CEO evaluation
│  ├─ Financial: Cash flow analysis, cost-cutting, emergency funding
│  ├─ People: Retain key talent, address burnout, remove toxic leaders
│  └─ Operations: Focus on core business, stabilize processes
│
└─ With rapid intervention: 30-40% survive
   Without intervention: 90% fail within 12 months

ELSE IF 2.5 ≤ Ω < 3.5 (Crisis) THEN
│
├─ STATUS: CRISIS - Major intervention required
│
├─ Target primary dysfunction:
│  ├─ Leadership failure (Π_leader < 5.0, ρ > 0.6)? → Leadership change/development
│  ├─ Coordination breakdown (CA < 4.0)? → Process stabilization
│  ├─ Cultural toxicity (ADR/EFI ≥ 5.0)? → Culture reset
│  ├─ Burnout epidemic (Sthermo ≥ 6.0)? → Workload and well-being
│  └─ Market failure (external)? → Strategic pivot
│
└─ Weekly leadership meetings, monthly Ω tracking
   Goal: Ω ≥ 3.5 by month 3; Ω ≥ 5.0 by month 6

ELSE IF 3.5 ≤ Ω < 5.0 (Stressed) THEN
│
├─ STATUS: STRESSED - Proactive intervention can prevent crisis
│
├─ Prevent escalation:
│  ├─ High entropy? → Clarity and predictability
│  ├─ Low coordination? → Collaboration infrastructure
│  ├─ Leadership stress? → Executive coaching and support
│  └─ Burnout emerging? → Workload and culture initiatives
│
└─ Bi-weekly leadership meetings, quarterly Ω tracking
   Goal: Ω ≥ 5.0 by month 6

ELSE IF 5.0 ≤ Ω < 6.5 (Viable) THEN
│
├─ STATUS: VIABLE - Organization functioning normally
│
├─ Sustain + improve:
│  ├─ Maintain positive culture
│  ├─ Strategic improvement (target weakest constructs)
│  └─ Preventive monitoring
│
└─ Monthly leadership check-ins, annual Ω reassessment
   Goal: Ω ≥ 6.5 by year 1

ELSE (Ω ≥ 6.5) (Thriving) THEN
│
├─ STATUS: THRIVING - Organization healthy and high-performing
│
├─ Enhance + scale:
│  ├─ Maintain excellence
│  ├─ Strategic growth
│  └─ Preventive vigilance
│
└─ Quarterly strategy sessions, annual Ω reassessment
   Maintain Ω ≥ 6.5 indefinitely

## Leadership Coherence Transmission Decision Tree

### Step 1: Calculate Π_leader and ρ

```
1. Π_leader (Individual Coherence of leader): 0-10 scale
2. ρ (Leadership Coupling Coefficient): 0-1 scale
3. Team outcome metrics: engagement, performance, retention, stress
```

### Step 2: Apply Leadership Decision Tree

```
IF Π_leader < 5.0 AND ρ > 0.6 THEN
│
├─ STATUS: CRITICAL - Leader fragmentation spreading to team
│
├─ FORMULA ADJUSTMENT:
│  Penalty = -0.1 × (5.0 - Π_leader) × ρ
│  Example: Π_leader = 3.5, ρ = 0.8 → Penalty = -0.12
│
├─ INTERVENTION OPTIONS:
│  ├─ Option A: Increase Π_leader (Leader development)
│  │  └─ Executive coaching, therapy, stress management
│  │     GOAL: Π_leader ≥ 6.0 within 6 months
│  │
│  ├─ Option B: Decrease ρ (Reduce team dependence)
│  │  └─ Distributed leadership, team autonomy building
│  │     GOAL: ρ ≤ 0.5 within 6 months
│  │
│  └─ Option C: Replace leader (If Options A & B fail)
│     CRITERIA: Π_leader < 3.0, unwilling to develop,
│               team already in crisis
│
└─ Monthly Π_leader assessment, quarterly ρ calculation
   Re-calculate penalty quarterly

ELSE IF Π_leader ≥ 6.0 AND ρ > 0.6 THEN
│
├─ STATUS: OPTIMAL - High-coherence leader with strong influence
│
├─ Maintain and leverage:
│  ├─ Ongoing executive coaching
│  ├─ Leverage positive coupling (visibility, communication)
│  └─ Succession planning
│
└─ Quarterly Π_leader assessment, annual ρ calculation

ELSE IF Π_leader < 5.0 AND ρ ≤ 0.6 THEN
│
├─ STATUS: CONTAINED - Leader struggling but team buffered
│
├─ Dual focus:
│  ├─ Support leader (executive coaching, therapy)
│  └─ Maintain team autonomy
│
└─ Team remains stable while leader recovers

ELSE (Π_leader ≥ 6.0 AND ρ ≤ 0.6)
│
├─ STATUS: DECOUPLED - High-coherence leader with low influence
│
├─ Assess: Is low ρ beneficial or problematic?
│  ├─ Beneficial: Strong autonomous team → Keep as is
│  └─ Problematic: Org needs strong leadership → Increase ρ
│
└─ If increasing ρ desired:
   Enhance leader visibility, structural changes, culture shift

END

## Consciousness Assessment Decision Tree

### Stage 1: Proxy Validation (Conscious Subjects)

```
STAGE 1: N=100 healthy volunteers

1. Measure gold standard:
   90-min narrative interview (Spsy_interview, 0-10 scale)
   5-axis coherence coding

2. Measure three proxies:
   - Behavioral proxy (15 min observation)
   - Linguistic proxy (30 min LIWC analysis)
   - Physiological proxy (2 hrs monitoring)

3. Validate correlations:
   FOR EACH PROXY:
     IF r ≥ 0.70 THEN Proxy VALID → Proceed to Stage 2
     ELSE IF 0.60 ≤ r < 0.70 THEN Proxy MARGINAL → Refine protocol
     ELSE (r < 0.60) Proxy INVALID → Do NOT use in Stages 2-3

GATE: Proceed to Stage 2 only if all three proxies r ≥ 0.70
```

### Stage 2: Sensitivity Tracking (Anesthesia)

```
STAGE 2: N=40 surgical patients

FOR EACH PATIENT:
1. Baseline (pre-induction): All proxies + interview
2. Induction: Track proxies at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% depth
3. Recovery: Proxies continuously, interview when coherent
4. Full recovery (post-surgery): All proxies + interview

ANALYSIS:
1. Monotonicity: Do proxies decline then increase?
2. Recovery: Do proxies return to baseline? (ICC ≥ 0.75)
3. Prediction: Do proxies predict recovery timing? (r ≥ 0.60)

GATE: Proceed to Stage 3 only if:
  - All proxies show monotonicity
  - At least 2 proxies have ICC ≥ 0.75
  - At least 1 proxy has r ≥ 0.60
```

### Stage 3: Outcome Prediction (Coma Patients)

```
STAGE 3: N=30 coma patients, 12-month follow-up

FOR EACH PATIENT:
1. Baseline (within 48 hrs): Measure three proxies
2. Calculate Ω_consciousness
3. Categorize: ≥ 3.0 (likely recovery), 1.0-3.0 (uncertain), ≤ 1.0 (poor)

FOLLOW-UP (12 months):
- Glasgow Coma Scale trajectory
- Consciousness recovery (yes/no)
- Functional independence (GOSE score)

VALIDATION:
1. Correlation: r(Ω_consciousness, GCS_recovery) ≥ 0.60?
2. Discrimination: AUC ≥ 0.72?
3. Sensitivity/Specificity: Both ≥ 0.70 and 0.65?

IF all validated THEN
  CONSCIOUSNESS FRAMEWORK VALIDATED
  Publish full validation, clinical implementation recommended
ELSE
  FRAMEWORK INCOMPLETE
  Refine proxies/formula, re-test
END
```

### Gate 1: Construct Validity (Week 4, Month 2)

```
QUESTION: Does Ω predict outcomes? (r ≥ 0.65?)

PROCESS:
1. Data archaeology (existing datasets)
2. Retrospective scoring
3. Outcome correlation
4. Diagnostics if needed

DECISION:
IF r ≥ 0.65 THEN
  STATUS: APPROVED
  Proceed to Phase 1 immediately
  Confidence: High (85% publication likelihood)

ELSE IF 0.55 ≤ r < 0.65 THEN
  STATUS: CONDITIONAL APPROVED
  Proceed with expanded samples (+30-50%)
  Confidence: Moderate (70-75% publication likelihood)

ELSE (r < 0.55) THEN
  STATUS: REJECTED - HALT Phase 1
  Iterate formula, re-test
  Proceed only after passing Gate 1

### Gate 2: Measurement Reliability (Month 3.5)

```
QUESTION: ICC ≥ 0.70 for all constructs?

PROCESS:
- Test-retest on N=20 couples
- Calculate ICC for each construct
- Validate Tstab reliability (r ≥ 0.60)
- Validate consciousness proxies (r ≥ 0.70)

DECISION:
IF all criteria met THEN
  STATUS: APPROVED
  Continue to Phase 2 on schedule
  Confidence: Very high (90% publication likelihood)

ELSE IF some constructs 0.65-0.69 THEN
  STATUS: CONDITIONAL

```

### Gate 3: Outcome Prediction (Month 6)

```
QUESTION: Do primary outcomes meet targets (p < 0.001)?

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
├─ Couples: Ω predicts breakup (r ≥ 0.65) OR therapy benefit (65% vs 40%)
├─ Consciousness: Anesthesia tracking (r ≥ 0.70)
├─ Leadership: Team outcomes correlated (r ≥ 0.60)
└─ Therapy: RCT benefit detectable (p < 0.05)
