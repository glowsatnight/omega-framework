## Overview: The Three-Tier Hierarchy

All 26 Omega v23.6 constructs can be measured at three levels of rigor, balancing **precision, cost, and time** based on assessment goals.

| Tier | Name | Time per Construct | Total Time (26) | Cost | Confidence | Best For |
|------|------|-------------------|-----------------|------|------------|----------|
| **1** | Rapid Proxy | 5-15 min | 2-4 hours | $100-300 | ±0.2-0.3 | Screening, self-assessment, low-stakes |
| **2** | Validated Scale | 30 min - 2 hrs | 6-12 hours (spread over weeks) | $500-2,000 | ±0.1-0.15 | Treatment planning, consulting |
| **3** | Gold Standard | 4-20 hrs | 50-200 hours (3-12 months) | $2,500-10,000+ | ±0.05-0.08 | Research, high-stakes decisions |

- ✅ Cost is limited
- ✅ You understand the trade-off: **rough but fast**

### Choose Tier 2 if:

- ✅ You want solid rigor but reasonable timeline
- ✅ You're willing to invest 2-6 weeks in assessment
- ✅ You will act on findings (accuracy matters)
- ✅ You have modest budget ($500-2K)

### Choose Tier 3 if:
- ✅ You're publishing research
- ✅ You're making high-stakes institutional decisions
- ✅ You need publication-grade validity
- ✅ You're willing to invest 3-12 months
- ✅ Budget permits $2.5K-10K+ per assessment

| **Confidence** | ±0.4 | ±0.2 | ±0.1 |
| **v23.6 Thresholds** | dΠ/dt < -0.5/year → RAPID DECLINE (-1.5 penalty); -0.5 to 0 → GRADUAL DECLINE; ≈ 0 → STABLE; 0 to +0.5 → GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT; > +0.5 → RAPID IMPROVEMENT | Same | Same |

#### 26. ρ (Leadership Coupling Coefficient)

**Formula:** ρ = Correlation(Leader_Π, Team_Outcome)  
Or more precisely: ρ = ∂(Team_State) / ∂(Leader_Π)

Scale: 0-1 (0 = no coupling, 1 = perfect coupling)

| Aspect | Tier 1 (10 min) | Tier 2 (8 hrs over 6 months) | Tier 3 (12 months) |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Method** | Observation + team member report | 6-month correlation tracking | Network + regression analysis |
| **Procedure** | Observe leader-team interaction (single meeting); ask team: "When your leader is stressed, how much does it affect you?" Rate 0 (no effect) to 10 (completely affected) | Monthly assessment of: leader Π, leader stress (0-10), team engagement (average), team performance metric. Calculate correlation(Leader_state, Team_state) | 12-month daily tracking: leader daily state (Π, stress, mood) + each team member's daily state. Network analysis: map influence pathways. Regression: predict team state from leader state (controlling for other factors) |
| **Scoring** | Average rating / 10 (convert to 0-1) | Absolute value of correlation (r) | Extract β coefficient = ρ; test: does high ρ + low leader Π predict poor team outcomes? |
| **Confidence** | ±0.2 | ±0.15 | ±0.08 |
| **v23.6 Thresholds** | ρ < 0.3 → LOW (team buffered); 0.3-0.6 → MODERATE (typical); ρ ≥ 0.6 → HIGH (team dependent). If Π_leader < 5.0 AND ρ > 0.6: apply penalty -0.1 × (5.0-Π_leader) × ρ | Same | Same |

## Practical Recommendations

### For Practitioners (Therapists, Coaches, Consultants)

1. **Start with Tier 1** for all new clients/organizations
   - Quick screening in first session
   - Identify high-risk cases immediately
   - Decide if deeper assessment warranted

2. **Use Tier 2 for active cases**
   - Treatment planning after initial screening
   - Track progress quarterly
   - Adjust interventions based on construct-level insights

3. **Reserve Tier 3 for special cases**
   - Clients pursuing research participation
   - High-stakes legal cases (custody evaluations)
   - Institutional audits with publication potential

### For Researchers

1. **Always use Tier 3** for publication-grade data
   - ICC ≥ 0.75 required for peer review
   - Multi-method triangulation expected
   - Longitudinal validation strengthens claims

2. **Use Tier 2 for pilot studies**
   - Test feasibility before full Tier 3 investment
   - Refine measurement protocols
   - Estimate effect sizes for power analysis

3. **Never publish Tier 1 data** without explicit caveats
   - Tier 1 = screening tool only
   - Not defensible as primary outcome measure

### For Organizations

1. **Annual pulse check: Tier 1** (all employees)
   - Quick, low-cost, identifies hot spots
   - Can survey entire organization in 1 day

2. **Department-level deep dive: Tier 2** (selected departments)
   - Follow up on Tier 1 red flags
   - Target interventions based on construct profiles

3. **Major restructuring: Tier 3** (full audit)
   - M&A due diligence
   - Legal risk assessment
   - Strategic transformation planning

### For Individuals (Self-Assessment)

1. **Use Tier 1 for personal insight**
   - Self-administer monthly
   - Track your own Ω, Π, Tstab trends
   - Identify when to seek professional help

2. **Upgrade to Tier 2 if considering major life changes**
   - Relationship decisions (marriage, divorce)
   - Career transitions (job change, entrepreneurship)
   - Health interventions (therapy, lifestyle change)

3. **Tier 3 not typically necessary** unless:
   - Participating in research study
   - Legal case requires expert assessment

---

## Quality Control: When to Upgrade Tiers

### Red Flags Suggesting Tier 1 Insufficient

- **High-stakes decision imminent** (divorce, custody, major investment)
- **Tier 1 results near threshold** (Ω = 3.5-5.0, ambiguous)
- **Tstab ≤ 0.4** (crisis window detected)
- **Multiple constructs conflicting** (high Positive but also high Abuse)
- **Legal or institutional accountability** required

**Action:** Upgrade to Tier 2 minimum

### Red Flags Suggesting Tier 2 Insufficient

- **Preparing for publication**
- **Legal testimony expected**
- **Institutional audit with reputational risk**
- **Tier 2 ICC < 0.70** on critical constructs
- **Outcome prediction validation** needed

**Action:** Upgrade to Tier 3
