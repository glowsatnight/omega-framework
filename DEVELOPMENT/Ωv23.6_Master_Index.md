## SECTION 6: DOMAIN APPLICATIONS AT A GLANCE

### Quick-Reference by Application

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Couples Therapy** | Micro-Ω (composite) | 2-4 weeks | 8-12 weeks | Predicts breakup r≥0.65 | Low power asymmetry measured accurately? |
| **Organizational Health** | Ω (standard) | 4-6 weeks | 6-12 weeks | Predicts collapse r≥0.65 | Cultural fit of constructs to org type? |
| **Crisis Timing** | Tstab + dΠ/dt | 1 hour | 4-6 hours | Crisis window prediction ±1 month | Sufficient data to calculate Tstab? |

## SECTION 9: RISK MITIGATION & TROUBLESHOOTING

### What If [X] Happens?

**Q: Phase 0 shows weak Ω validity (r=0.48)?**
A: Iterate formula (2-4 weeks, $0 cost). Test which constructs underperforming. Likely issues: (1) Entropy weighting too high? → Reduce to 0.8× (2) Abuse weighting wrong scale? → Re-calibrate (3) Domain-specific issue? → Develop couples-specific Ω variant. Then re-test Phase 0 data with revised formula.

**Q: Couples ICC comes back 0.62 (below 0.70 target)?**
A: Likely cause: One or two constructs unreliable. Use stepwise ICC analysis: Test each construct separately. Identify weak ones (IAE, CA, HA?). Refine measurement for weak constructs (move to Tier 2 for recruitment? Better training?). Expected impact: +3-4 points on ICC. Retest Phase 1 subset (N=20). If ICC still <0.70, may need to drop unreliable construct or redesign it.

**Q: Tstab thresholds don't predict crisis timing as expected?**
A: Either: (1) Frequency/amplitude/damping formula needs adjustment (recalibrate on Phase 1 data) or (2) Threshold values wrong (0.2, 0.4, 0.7 → adjust empirically). Likely adjustment: If threshold 0.2 predicts 1-6 weeks instead of 1-4, move to 0.25. Can adjust empirically with 0 additional cost (use Phase 1 data).

**Q: Consciousness Stage 2 shows proxies don't track anesthesia depth?**
A: Problem likely: Proxy formula weights (behavioral 1/3, linguistic 1/3, physiological 1/3) not optimal. Solution: (1) Logistic regression to reweight proxies based on observed anesthesia depth (2) May find physiological proxies drive prediction, behavioral/linguistic less important. Cost: +$10K-20K. Timeline: +4 weeks. Proceed to Stage 3 with refined proxies.

**Q: Budget overruns in Phase 1 (recruitment slower than expected)?**
A: Solution: Expand recruitment windows and/or incentives (+$10K-15K). Prioritize Micro-Ω (couples) as Phase 1A (must complete). De-prioritize lower-confidence domains until funding secured. Decision: Continue Phase 1 at slower pace, OR pause and seek additional funding.

**Q: First journal submissions rejected?**
A: Expected. Target 2-3 submissions per paper. If rejected: (1) Check feedback for methodological concerns (might indicate Phase 1 design issue) (2) Revise based on feedback and resubmit to second-tier journal (3) Continue Phase 2-3 validation in parallel (won't wait for publication). Likely outcome: 85%+ papers eventually published; first-pass acceptance rate 50-60% (normal for new frameworks).
