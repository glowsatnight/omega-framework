## SECTION 6: POWER ASYMMETRY INDEX WEIGHTING (REVISED)

### 6.1 The Problem: Arbitrary Weighting

v23.5 proposed PAI (Power Asymmetry Index) = (Resources_A / Resources_B), where Resources = 0.35(Economic) + 0.25(Social) + 0.15(Physical) + 0.25(Emotional).

The weighting (0.35/0.25/0.15/0.25) was presented without justification. This creates vulnerability:
- Peer reviewers will ask: "Why these specific numbers?"
- Alternative weightings produce different results
- Small changes shift conclusions about exploitation risk

**Example of weighting sensitivity:**
```
Partner A: $50K income, 5-person network, healthy, Π=6.0
Partner B: $80K income, 20-person network, disabled, Π=4.5

Current weighting (0.35/0.25/0.15/0.25):
Resources_A = 0.35(0.63) + 0.25(0.25) + 0.15(10) + 0.25(1.33) = 2.11
Resources_B = 0.35(1.0) + 0.25(1.0) + 0.15(0.1) + 0.25(1.0) = 0.87
PAI = 2.11/0.87 = 2.43 (high asymmetry)

Alternative weighting (0.40/0.20/0.10/0.30):
Resources_A = 0.40(0.63) + 0.20(0.25) + 0.10(10) + 0.30(1.33) = 1.70
Resources_B = 0.40(1.0) + 0.20(1.0) + 0.10(0.1) + 0.30(1.0) = 0.91
PAI = 1.70/0.91 = 1.87 (still high, but different threshold crossing)
```

Result: Different weightings can push couples above/below "exploitation risk" threshold (PAI > 1.5).

### 6.2 v23.6 Solution: Three Empirical Weighting Methods

Rather than claiming fixed weights are correct, v23.6 provides three defensible approaches:

#### **Method 1: Outcome Prediction (Preferred if data available)**

**Approach:**
1. Recruit N=50+ couples with known abuse outcomes
2. Measure all four resource dimensions separately
3. Code outcome: Abuse present (1) vs. No abuse (0)
4. Logistic regression: Predict abuse from four resource components
5. Output: Empirically-derived weights that best predict abuse

**Example result:**
```
If regression shows:
- Economic resources: β = 0.35 (strongest predictor)
- Social resources: β = 0.22 (moderate)
- Physical resources: β = 0.10 (weak)
- Emotional resources: β = 0.28 (strong)

Normalize: 0.35 + 0.22 + 0.10 + 0.28 = 0.95
Normalized weights: 0.37/0.23/0.11/0.29

This differs from v23.5 guess (0.35/0.25/0.15/0.25) but is empirically justified.
```

**Advantages:**
- Weights directly linked to abuse prediction
- Defensible in peer review
- Can update as more outcome data collected

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires outcome data (abuse confirmation)
- May be domain-specific (weights valid for couples, not necessarily orgs)

---

#### **Method 2: Expert Consensus (If outcome data unavailable)**

**Approach:**
1. Convene panel of experts:
   - Domestic violence researchers (3-5)
   - Couple therapists (2-3)
   - Social workers (2)
   - Survivors or advocates (1-2)
   
2. Present: "For identifying exploitation risk in intimate partnerships, how important is each resource type?"

3. Rate each on 0-10 scale (how important is this for predicting abuse risk?)

4. Average ratings; normalize to weights

**Example result:**
```
Expert ratings (scale 0-10):
Economic resources:    Mean = 8.2 (most experts: money controls exit options)
Social resources:      Mean = 7.1 (isolation enables abuse)
Physical resources:    Mean = 4.5 (less directly predictive than economic/social)
Emotional resources:   Mean = 7.8 (low self-esteem enables trapping)

Normalize to weights:
8.2 + 7.1 + 4.5 + 7.8 = 27.6
Normalized: 0.30/0.26/0.16/0.28
```

**Advantages:**
- Incorporates domain expertise
- Transparent (can see expert reasoning)
- Defensible in publication

**Disadvantages:**
- Subjective (different panels might vary)
- May vary by cultural context
- Requires expert recruitment

---

#### **Method 3: Sensitivity Analysis (If both outcome and expert data unavailable)**

**Approach:**
1. Test multiple weight sets:
   - v23.5 baseline: 0.35/0.25/0.15/0.25
   - Uniform: 0.25/0.25/0.25/0.25
   - Economics-heavy: 0.40/0.20/0.10/0.30
   - Emotional-heavy: 0.25/0.20/0.15/0.40
   - Others based on theory

2. For each weight set, classify couples as "exploitation risk" (PAI > 1.5) or not

3. Report findings for all weights: "Results are robust across weightings" or "Results sensitive to economic vs. emotional weighting"

**Advantages:**
- Transparent about uncertainty
- Shows which weights matter
- Defensible in academic contexts (honest about limitations)

**Disadvantages:**
- Does not resolve which weights are "correct"
- May be seen as hedging
- Requires careful interpretation

---

### 6.3 v23.6 Recommendation

**For Phase 1 validation:**
- Use Method 1 (Outcome Prediction) if recruiting couples with abuse outcome data
- Use Method 2 (Expert Consensus) if outcome data unavailable but expert access possible
- Use Method 3 (Sensitivity Analysis) if neither outcome nor expert data available; acknowledge this as limitation

**For publication:**
- State explicitly: "Weights derived via [Method X]" with full transparency
- Include sensitivity table showing how results change with alternative weights
- This transparency actually increases credibility vs. v23.5's unsupported claims

## SECTION 7: THREE-TIER MEASUREMENT HIERARCHY (EXPANDED)

### 7.1 Overview: The Three Tiers

All 26 v23.6 constructs have measurement protocols at three levels:

**TIER 1: Rapid Proxy (Fast Assessment)**
- Time: 5-15 minutes per construct
- Cost: $100-300 professional cost
- Confidence: ±0.2-0.3 on 0-10 scale
- Best for: Screening, cost-constrained, low-stakes decisions
- User: Practitioners, coaches, individuals

**TIER 2: Validated Scale (Standard Assessment)**
- Time: 30 minutes - 2 hours total
- Cost: $500-2,000 professional cost
- Confidence: ±0.1-0.15 on 0-10 scale
- Best for: Routine practice, treatment planning, moderate rigor
- User: Therapists, consultants, organizational leaders

**TIER 3: Gold Standard (Research-Grade Assessment)**
- Time: 4-20 hours
- Cost: $2,500+ professional cost
- Confidence: ±0.05-0.08 on 0-10 scale
- Best for: Research, high-stakes decisions, publication
- User: Researchers, clinical trials, institutional audits

### 7.2 How to Choose Your Tier

**Choose Tier 1 if:**
- You need a quick answer (< 1 hour)
- You are screening multiple systems and can't measure all deeply
- The stakes are moderate (not high-risk decision)
- Cost is limited
- You understand the trade-off: rough but fast

**Choose Tier 2 if:**
- You are making treatment/intervention decisions
- You want solid rigor but reasonable timeline
- You are willing to invest 2-6 weeks in assessment
- You will act on findings (so accuracy matters)
- You have modest budget

**Choose Tier 3 if:**
- You are publishing research
- You are making high-stakes institutional decisions
- You need publication-grade validity
- You are willing to invest 3-12 months
- Budget permits ($2K-5K per construct for full rigor)

### 7.3 Complete Tier Protocol: Example Construct (Spsy - Psychological Entropy)

#### **TIER 1: Rapid Proxy (5-10 minutes)**

**Procedure:**
1. Observe subject's communication (5 min) or ask:
   - "In the last week, how many times did you find yourself confused about what you actually believe?"
   - "How many topics do you avoid discussing because the discussion always goes in circles?"
   - "How often do you notice yourself contradicting something you said before?"
2. Count incidents or rate frequency (0-10)
3. Spsy_T1 = 10 - (frequency_rating)

**Example:**
- Subject reports "multiple times daily" contradictions → Frequency = 8/10 → Spsy_T1 = 2

**Confidence:** ±0.3 (rough estimate)

---

#### **TIER 2: Validated Scale (1-2 hours)**

**Procedure:**
1. Conduct 30-minute interview covering:
   - Narrative coherence ("Tell me about a typical day")
   - Emotional stability ("How do you typically respond to stress?")
   - Belief consistency ("What are your core values, and do your actions align?")
   - Identity stability ("How would you describe yourself? Does this description stay consistent?")

2. Transcribe or record (30 min listening)

3. Run LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) analysis on transcript (30 min setup + software)
   - Extract: Absolutist language %, emotional extremity %, contradiction markers
   
4. Score: Spsy_T2 = 10 - [(absolutism_% + extremity_% + contradiction_%) / 3]

**Example:**
- Transcript shows 15% absolute language, 22% emotional extremity, 8% contradiction markers
- Average = 15% → Spsy_T2 = 10 - 0.15 = 9.85, capped at 10 (high coherence)

**Confidence:** ±0.15

---

#### **TIER 3: Gold Standard (10-20 hours)**

**Procedure:**
1. Extended interview (90 minutes)
   - Life narrative (20 min)
   - Value exploration (20 min)
   - Belief consistency across domains (20 min)
   - Stress response & coping (20 min)
   - Integration check: "How do you make sense of apparent contradictions?" (10 min)

2. Rate coherence on 5 dimensions (from v23.5):
   - Narrative consistency (1-10)
   - Emotional-behavioral alignment (1-10)
   - Value-action alignment (1-10)
   - Identity stability (1-10)
   - Meaning-making capacity (1-10)

3. Longitudinal tracking (3+ assessments over 90 days)
   - Check stability of coherence over time
   - Rate change: Is coherence stable, improving, or declining?

4. Multi-rater agreement:
   - Two independent raters score same interview
   - Inter-rater ICC ≥ 0.75 for valid assessment

5. Final score: Spsy_T3 = Average of 5 dimensions, with longitudinal adjustment

**Example:**
- Dimension scores: 8, 7, 8, 7.5, 8
- T3 baseline = 7.7
- Longitudinal tracking shows slight decline (average 7.4 at month 3)
- Adjusted score: 7.5

**Confidence:** ±0.10

### 8.4 Domain 3: Consciousness & Neuroscience

#### **Primary Constructs (Spsy Proxies):**
- Behavioral: Defection rate, contradiction, engagement drop
- Linguistic: LIWC analysis of communication
- Physiological: HRV, cortisol, sleep-wake cycling

#### **Domain-Specific Interpretation:**
```

Ω_consciousness 3.0-5.0: Severely impaired; minimal awareness
Ω_consciousness 1.0-3.0: Unconscious; no measurable awareness
Ω_consciousness < 1.0:  Absent consciousness
```

#### **Measurement Approach (Neuroscience Lab):**
1. Stage 1 (4 weeks): Proxy validation on conscious subjects
   - N=100 healthy volunteers

   - Compare all three proxies to interview
   - Target: r ≥ 0.70 all proxies

2. Stage 2 (8 weeks): Anesthesia sensitivity tracking
   - N=40 surgical patients
   - Track proxies during induction/recovery
   - Test: Do proxies follow consciousness depth?
   - Target: Monotonic change with anesthesia depth

### 8.5 Domain 4: Psychotherapy Outcomes

#### **Primary Constructs:**
- Π (Coherence): Client's ability to tell consistent story
- RA (Recovery Potential): Client's resources for change
- Spsy (Psychological Entropy): Client's internal chaos
- dΠ/dt (Coherence velocity): Rate of improvement

#### **Domain-Specific Interpretation:**
```
Client improving if:
- Baseline Π < 5.0 AND dΠ/dt > +0.5/month (increasing coherence)
- Baseline Spsy > 6.0 AND dSpsy/dt < -0.3/month (decreasing entropy)
- Both metrics improving together = therapy working
```

#### **RCT Design (Micro-Ω-Guided vs. Standard):**
- Intervention group: Therapist uses Micro-Ω monthly to guide focus
  - Low Π? Focus on narrative integration
  - High Spsy? Focus on emotion regulation
  - Low RA? Focus on resource building
  
- Control group: Standard therapy (therapist unaware of Ω)

- Hypothesis: Ω-guided therapy 65% improvement vs. 40% standard (p<0.05)

#### **Expected Publications:**
- "Coherence Tracking as Therapy Progress Indicator"
- "Personalized Therapy Targets Based on Omega Assessment"
- "Randomized Trial: Omega-Guided vs. Standard Therapy Outcomes"

### 8.6 Domain 5: Leadership & Executive Performance

#### **Primary Constructs:**
- Π (Leader Coherence): Leader's ability to maintain coherent vision
- dΠ/dt (Leader Coherence Velocity): Rate of leader change
- ρ (Leadership Coupling): How much leader's state transmits to team
- RA (Leader Recovery): Can leader bounce back from setback?

#### **Domain-Specific Interpretation:**
```
Leader Health:
- High Π (7+): Leader coherent; team trusts direction
- Declining Π (dΠ/dt < -0.3/quarter): Leader stress; team anxiety rises
- High ρ (0.6+): Leader mood strongly affects team performance
- Low RA (< 5.0): Leader brittle; team destabilizes on leader setback
```

#### **Measurement Approach (Executive Coach):**
1. Baseline: Π assessment + team baseline performance
2. Monthly: Leader self-check (Π trend, stress level)
3. Quarterly: Coach interview (deeper Π assessment + RA evaluation)
4. Longitudinal: Track leader Π + team outcomes (retention, performance, innovation)

#### **Expected Publications:**
- "Leadership Coherence as Predictor of Team Outcomes"
- "Leader Stress Transmission: Measuring Coupling Coefficient"
- "Executive Resilience: Recovery Potential as Leadership Asset"

### 8.7 Domain 6: AI Ethics & Artificial Consciousness

#### **Primary Constructs:**
- Ω_consciousness applied to LLMs, robots, autonomous agents
- Question: Can AI have "coherence" (consistency of outputs across contexts)?
- Measurement: Apply Spsy proxy hierarchy to AI system outputs

#### **Domain-Specific Interpretation:**
```
High-Coherence AI:
- Outputs are consistent across prompts
- Reasoning is transparent (can trace logic)
- Contradictions rare
- Values stable across contexts

Low-Coherence AI:
- Outputs contradict previous responses
- Reasoning opaque
- Values shift with prompt
- Unreliable agency
```

#### **Measurement Approach (AI Research Lab):**
1. Behavioral proxy: Measure consistency of outputs on repeated prompts
2. Linguistic proxy: Analyze outputs for contradiction markers (LIWC)
3. Relational proxy: Test whether AI can maintain goals across conversation

#### **Expected Publications:**
- "Coherence Assessment Framework for Autonomous Systems"
- "Consciousness as a Property of AI: Thermodynamic Foundations"
- "Ethical Constraints on Artificial Coherence: When Should AI Be Coherent?"

### 9.2 Validation Gates & Decision Criteria

#### **GATE 0 (Now): Phase 0 Approval**
**Decision:** Should we do construct validity check?
**Approval:** YES (low-cost insurance against formula failure)

---

#### **GATE 1 (Week 4): Phase 0 Results**
**Question:** Does Ω predict outcomes r ≥ 0.65?

**Decision Matrix:**
```
IF r ≥ 0.65:
  Status: APPROVED
  Action: Proceed to Phase 1 immediately
  Timeline: 18-20 months (on track)
  Budget: $300K-460K (on track)
  Confidence: High (85%+ publication likelihood)

ELSE IF 0.55 ≤ r < 0.65:
  Status: CONDITIONAL APPROVED
  Action: Proceed with expanded samples (+30-50% N)
  Timeline: +4-6 weeks
  Budget: +$40K-60K
  Confidence: Moderate (70-75% publication likelihood)

ELSE IF r < 0.55:
  Status: REJECTED
  Action: HALT Phase 1; iterate formula (2-4 weeks, $0 cost)
  Options: (A) Reweight constructs, (B) Remove weak constructs, (C) Domain-specific formula
  Then: Re-test revised formula on Phase 0 data
  Proceed to Phase 1 only after passing Gate 1
```

---

#### **GATE 2 (Week 14): Phase 1 Interim**
**Question:** Are measurements on track (ICC ≥ 0.70, Tstab r ≥ 0.60)?

**Decision Matrix:**
```
IF ICC ≥ 0.70 AND Tstab r ≥ 0.60 AND Consciousness r ≥ 0.70:
  Status: APPROVED
  Action: Continue to Phase 2 on schedule
  Confidence: Very high (90%+ publication likelihood)

ELSE IF ICC = 0.65-0.69 (any construct) OR Tstab r = 0.50-0.60:
  Status: CONDITIONAL
  Action: Extend Phase 1 by 4-6 weeks; refine measurement protocols
  Cost: +$20K-30K
  Continue to Phase 2 after refinement

ELSE IF ICC < 0.65 on multiple constructs:
  Status: PROBLEM
  Action: Diagnose weak constructs (stepwise ICC analysis)
  Options: (A) Move to Tier 2 for affected constructs, (B) Redesign construct, (C) Drop construct
  Timeline: +2-3 weeks diagnostics
  Then: Resume Phase 1 with revised protocols
```

---

#### **GATE 3 (Month 6): Phase 2 Outcomes**
**Question:** Do primary outcomes meet targets?

  Confidence: Very high (85%+ publication likelihood)

ELSE IF 2-3 criteria met, 1 borderline:
  Status: APPROVED WITH CAUTION
  Action: Proceed to Phase 3; note limitations in publications
  Confidence: High (75-80% publication likelihood)

ELSE IF Multiple criteria unmet:
  Status: PROBLEM
  Action: Pivot strategy; focus validation on highest-confidence domains
  Timeline: Delay publication 4-6 months (wait for Phase 3 preliminary results)
  Confidence: Moderate (50-60% publication likelihood)
```

---

#### **GATE 4 (Month 18): Phase 3 Complete**

---

### Core Viability Formula (v23.6)

#### **For Standard Scale (N ≥ 50):**
```
Ω = [Positive / (Entropy × 1.0 + Abuse × 0.5)] - ConcentrationPenalty ± TemporalAdjustments

Where:
Positive = (IAE + CA + HA + HE + dXd + RA) / 6
Entropy = (Smicro + Smeso + Smacro + Sthermo + Spsy + Stemporal) / 6
Abuse = (ADR + EFI + HERS + CI + Severity/Prevalence) / 5 × (1 - CI)

ConcentrationPenalty = 1.0 if any construct > 8.0 (risk concentration), else 0
TemporalAdjustments:
  - If dΠ/dt < -0.5/year: -1.5 penalty
  - If Tstab < 0.3: -1.0 × (0.3-Tstab)/0.3 penalty
  - If Π_leader < 5.0 AND ρ > 0.6: -0.1 × (5.0-Π_leader) × ρ
```

#### **For Micro Scale (N = 2-10):**
```
Ω_micro = [Positive / (Entropy × 1.0 + Abuse × 0.5)]

No concentration penalty (too small for meaningful concentration)
Confidence band: ± (3.0 - 1.0 × ln(N)) [empirically derived]
  N=2: ±1.67
  N=5: ±1.06
  N=10: ±0.75
```

#### **For Consciousness (N = 1):**
```
Ω_consciousness = [IAE + CA + HA + HE + dXd + RA] / 6
                / (Spsy_proxy × 1.0 + Entropy_neural × 0.5)

Where Spsy_proxy = average of (behavioral + linguistic + physiological proxies)
Confidence band: ±2.0 (proxies less reliable than direct measurement)
```
