## PHASE 0: CONSTRUCT VALIDITY BASELINE (All Domains)

### Why Phase 0 First?

Before investing $280K+ in domain-specific validation studies, Phase 0 (4 weeks, $10K-20K) confirms that core Ω actually predicts outcomes on existing data.

### Phase 0 Protocol (Integrated Across All Domains)

#### **Step 1: Data Archaeology (Week 1)**

Search for existing datasets matching criteria:
- **Couples Data:** Dyadic Adjustment Scale, Gottman datasets, couple therapy clinic records (N≥30)
- **Organizational Data:** Published performance studies, company case files, team outcomes (N≥50)
- **Consciousness Data:** Published anesthesia studies, coma registries (N≥30)
- **Therapy Data:** Published RCTs, clinic outcome data (N≥50)
- **Leadership Data:** Published executive coaching studies, team performance data (N≥30)

#### **Step 2: Retrospective Ω Scoring (Week 2)**

Map available data to 16 Ω constructs. Example for couples:

```
From DAS scale items "We communicate well," "We resolve conflicts," etc.:
- IAE: Map to communication items
- CA: Map to problem-solving items
- HA: Estimate from demographics or set to 5.0 (neutral)
- HE: Map to engagement/novelty items
- dXd: Calculate trend from baseline to follow-up
- RA: Map to resilience/support items
- Entropy constructs: Reverse-code from negative items
- Abuse constructs: If abuse data available, score; otherwise 0 (safe assumption)

Calculate: Ω = [Positive / (Entropy × 1 + Abuse × 0.5)]
```

#### **Step 3: Outcome Correlation Analysis (Week 3)**

Test: Does Ω predict domain-specific outcome?

**For each domain:**
- **Couples:** Relationship dissolution (together/separated at 12 months)
  - Target: r(Ω, breakup) ≥0.65 OR AUC≥0.72
  
- **Organizations:** Organizational survival/performance
  - Target: r(Ω, performance_score) ≥0.65 OR bankruptcy prediction AUC≥0.72
  
- **Consciousness:** Consciousness level in existing anesthesia data
  - Target: r(Ω_consciousness, measured_consciousness) ≥0.65
  
- **Therapy:** Symptom improvement at follow-up
  - Target: r(Ω, improvement) ≥0.65
  
- **Leadership:** Team performance or retention
  - Target: r(Π_leader, team_outcomes) ≥0.60

#### **Step 4: Domain-Specific Diagnostics (Week 4)**

If overall validation moderate or weak:
```
Stepwise regression: Which constructs drive predictions in each domain?

Examples:
- Couples: CA (problem-solving) strongest predictor? Or HA (diversity)?
- Organizations: Sthermo (stress) matters most? Or dXd (trajectory)?
- Consciousness: Behavioral proxies > linguistic proxies?
- Therapy: Preexisting RA (recovery) predicts therapy success?
- Leadership: Π (coherence) > Spsy (psychological entropy)?

Result: Domain-specific formula calibration if needed
```

### Phase 0 Gate Decision Framework

```
SUCCESS (r ≥ 0.65 across all domains):
├─ Decision: Proceed to Phase 1 for all domains
├─ Timeline: 18-20 months total
├─ Budget: $300K-460K total (as planned)
└─ Strategy: Publish Phase 1-2 results around month 12-14

MODERATE (0.55 ≤ r < 0.65 in any domain):
├─ Decision: Proceed with expanded sample sizes
├─ Action: Increase N by 30-50% in that domain
├─ Timeline: +4-6 weeks per affected domain
├─ Budget: +$40K-60K total
├─ Strategy: Note domain-specific limitations in publications

WEAK (r < 0.55 in any domain):
├─ Decision: PAUSE that domain; iterate formula
├─ Action: Return to v23.4/v23.5 development; refine construct weighting
├─ Timeline: 2-4 weeks iteration + re-test
├─ Budget: $0 (no new data; reuse Phase 0 data)
└─ Strategy: Once formula improved, proceed to Phase 1 for that domain only
```

## DOMAIN 1: COUPLES THERAPY & RELATIONSHIP SCIENCE

### 1.1 Gap Addressed: Micro-Ω Validation (from v23.5)

v23.5 proposed Micro-Ω protocol for small systems (N=2-10) but only outlined theoretical design. v23.6 provides complete validation framework.

### 1.2 Research Questions

1. **Primary:** Does Micro-Ω predict couple breakup with ICC ≥0.70 and outcome prediction r≥0.65?

2. **Tstab secondary:** Do Tstab thresholds (0.2, 0.4, 0.7) predict collapse timing (1 week, 1 month, 3 months)?

3. **Consent Integrity:** Can CI + PAI identify exploitation risk with sensitivity≥0.70, specificity≥0.65?

4. **Intervention:** Do Micro-Ω-guided therapy show better outcomes than standard therapy?

### 1.3 Study Design: Phase 1-2 (14 weeks, $80K-120K)

#### **Phase 1: Micro-Ω Validation (Weeks 1-10)**

**Sample:** N=50 couples
- Stratified by relationship length: ≤2 years (N=15), 3-10 years (N=20), >10 years (N=15)
- Mix of help-seeking (therapy) and non-help-seeking (community) couples

**Baseline Assessment (T1, Week 0):**
- RAP Lite-Micro (2-4 weeks, $500-1,500 cost) OR RAP Clinical-Micro (8-12 weeks, $5K-15K)
  - For study: Use RAP Clinical-Micro on all N=50 (research rigor)
  - Measure: All 16 Ω constructs + confidence bands + Tstab
  
- Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS), 32-item gold-standard measure
- Gottman Relationship Stability Rating (identify at-risk couples)
- Consent Integrity assessment (structured 3-axis interview)
- Power Asymmetry audit (income, social network, physical/emotional resources)

**Measurement: Test-Retest ICC (Week 2)**
- Subset N=20 couples, measure twice, 2-week interval
- Calculate ICC for each construct + composite Ω
- Target: ICC ≥0.65 for each construct; ≥0.70 for composite Ω

**Follow-Up Assessments:**
- T2 (Week 12): Post-assessment (if therapy received) or routine check
- T3 (Week 26): Mid-follow-up
- T4 (Week 52): 12-month outcome
  - Outcome variable: Together (1) / Separated or Divorced (0)
  - Secondary: Relationship satisfaction (DAS score)

**Data Analysis:**
- Primary: Point-biserial correlation Ω vs. breakup
  - Target: r ≥ 0.65 OR AUC ≥ 0.72 (ROC curve)
  
- Secondary: Tstab predicting collapse timing
  - Survival analysis: Does Tstab ≤0.4 predict collapse within 1-3 months?
  - Target: HR ≥1.8 (hazard ratio)
  
- Exploratory: CI + PAI identifying exploitation
  - Target: CI + PAI combination sensitivity ≥0.70 for identifying abuse-risk couples

**Timeline:** 14 weeks (recruitment + baseline + 12-month follow-up starts; full follow-up completes in Phase 2)  
**Cost:** $80K-120K

---

#### **Phase 2: Intervention Outcome & Validation Completion (Weeks 11-14)**

**Design: Quasi-experimental with standard-care comparison**
- N=50 from Phase 1, plus N=50 new couples
- Intervention group (N=50): Micro-Ω-guided therapy (therapist uses Ω for treatment planning)
- Comparison group (N=50): Standard therapy (therapist unaware of Ω; standard protocols)

**Intervention:** Micro-Ω-guided therapy protocol
- Baseline Micro-Ω assessment informs therapy focus
  - Low CA (coordination)? → Focus on problem-solving skills
  - Low RA (recovery)? → Focus on conflict resolution / repair attempts
  - High Smeso (relational entropy)? → Focus on attachment / emotional safety
  - High PAI with low CI? → Safety planning; identify exploitation
  
- Monthly Micro-Ω reassessment tracks therapy progress
- Therapist adjusts focus based on construct changes

**Outcome Measures:**
- Therapy improvement: DAS score change from baseline to 12 weeks
- Relationship stability: Together vs. broken at 6-month follow-up
- Hypothesis: Micro-Ω-guided therapy shows 65% improvement rate vs. 40% standard therapy (p<0.05)

**Timeline:** 14 weeks (concurrent with Phase 1 follow-up)  
**Cost:** Included in Phase 1 budget ($80K-120K covers both recruitment cohorts)

## DOMAIN 3: TEMPORAL DYNAMICS & ORGANIZATIONAL COLLAPSE PREDICTION

### 3.1 Gap Addressed: Tstab Validation (from v23.5)

v23.5 proposed Tstab but validation approach unclear. v23.6 specifies empirical crisis-window validation.

### 3.2 Study Design: Phase 1-2 (14 weeks, $60K-100K)

**Sample:** N=30 organizations + N=20 couples (overlaps with Domain 1)

**Baseline:**
- 30-60 day behavioral log (daily outcome measure, incident count, or satisfaction rating)
- Calculate: Frequency (f), Amplitude (A), Damping (δ), Composite Tstab
- Measure: Original Ω, dXd (trajectory), baseline outcome

**Follow-Up:**
- Track: When does collapse/breakup happen?
- Measure: Actual time-to-event (weeks or months)

**Validation:**
- Does Tstab ≤0.2 predict 1-4 week collapse? (Target: 80%+ of Tstab≤0.2 collapse within 4 weeks)
- Does Tstab ≤0.4 predict 1-3 month collapse? (Target: 70%+ of Tstab≤0.4 collapse within 3 months without intervention)
- Does Tstab >0.7 maintain stability? (Target: <5% collapse rate at 12 months)

**Cost:** $60K-100K (shared equipment/software licensing with couples study)
