# DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## How to Scale Omega v23.6 from Pilot to Full Implementation

---

## PART 1: OVERVIEW

### What is Deployment?

**Deployment** = taking Omega from research setting (controlled, small-scale) into real-world use (uncontrolled, many users, operational complexity).

**Transition path:**
```
Phase 2 RCT (360 people, controlled) 
    ↓
Phase 3 Pilot Deployment (50-100 practitioners, 1-2 locations)
    ↓
Scale-Up (500+ practitioners, national/international)
```

### Success Metrics

Deployment succeeds if:

1. **Adoption:** 50%+ of target users integrate Omega into workflow
2. **Fidelity:** Users apply Omega correctly 70%+ of the time
3. **Outcomes:** Real-world results match Phase 2 RCT findings
4. **Safety:** No adverse events emerge at scale
5. **Cost-effectiveness:** Cost per prevented outcome acceptable
6. **Sustainability:** Revenue covers operational costs

## PART 6: RISK MANAGEMENT & SAFETY

### 6.1 Safety Monitoring

**Potential harms:**
1. Practitioner over-relying on Ω score, ignoring clinical judgment
2. Client receives discouraging Ω score, loses hope
3. Misuse of Ω in custody battles, firing decisions (outside clinical intent)
4. Data breach exposing client information
5. Practitioners applying protocol incorrectly, damaging client

**Mitigation:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Over-reliance on score | Training emphasizes: "Ω is one data point, not the truth" |
| Client discouragement | Protocol: frame high Ω as "opportunity for intervention," not doom |
| Misuse outside clinical | Licensing agreement: "For clinical/therapeutic use only" |
| Data breach | HIPAA/GDPR compliant infrastructure, regular security audits |
| Incorrect application | Certification requirement, fidelity audits, malpractice coverage required |

### 6.2 Ethical Guidelines

**Create Code of Ethics for Omega practitioners:**

1. **Informed consent:** Clients know Ω is being used and what it means
2. **Confidentiality:** Ω data protected same as clinical records
3. **Clinical judgment:** Ω informs but doesn't replace human decision-making
4. **Equity:** Omega applied fairly across demographic groups
5. **Transparency:** Limitations and uncertainty acknowledged
6. **Professional responsibility:** Practitioners maintain relevant credentials/licenses

### 6.3 Adverse Event Reporting

**If a practitioner reports client harm attributed to Omega:**

1. Immediate response (24 hours): Contact practitioner, understand incident
2. Investigation: Review case details, assess if Omega misuse likely
3. Remediation: Provide additional training, suspend certification if needed
4. Learning: Share (de-identified) learnings with practitioner community
5. Documentation: Maintain incident log for regulatory review

**Reporting structure:**
- Incident → Implementation Director → Clinical Lead → Possible board review (if serious)

---

## PART 7: LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY

### 7.1 Continuous Improvement Cycle

**Every 6 months:**

1. **Gather user feedback**
   - Surveys: "What's working? What needs to improve?"
   - Focus groups: Deep dive with 5-10 practitioners
   - Support tickets: Categorize common issues

2. **Review outcome data**
   - Are deployed practitioners seeing similar results to Phase 2?
   - Any domains where Ω works better/worse?
   - Any demographic differences in outcomes?

3. **Refine training**
   - Where are fidelity problems? Retrain those modules
   - New use cases emerging? Create new training modules
   - Update based on real-world learning

4. **Update protocol**
   - If outcomes suggest construct weights need adjustment, revise Ω formula
   - If new application (e.g., AI ethics) shows promise, create domain module
   - Keep framework living, evolving with evidence

### 7.2 Research Pipeline

**Maintain academic credibility alongside commercial deployment:**

**Publish regularly:**
- Phase 3a results (early adopter outcomes): 12-18 months into deployment
- Phase 3b results (scaled outcomes): 24-30 months
- Cost-effectiveness analysis: 30 months
- Comparative effectiveness vs. other tools: 36+ months

**Targets:**
- Peer-reviewed journals (2-3 publications/year at scale)
- Conferences (practitioner + academic)
- Practice guidelines (via professional organizations)

**Why:** Maintains credibility, attracts high-quality practitioners, enables grant funding

### 7.3 Expansion to New Domains

**Once couples/orgs/consciousness validated, expand to:**

- **Education:** Student retention, classroom dynamics
- **Criminal justice:** Recidivism prediction, rehabilitation potential
- **AI systems:** Behavioral consistency, alignment
- **Healthcare:** Patient adherence, team cohesion

**For each new domain:**
- Adapt constructs to domain-specific realities
- Run Phase 0-1 validation in new domain
- Train practitioners in that field
- Scale like Phase 3a-b
