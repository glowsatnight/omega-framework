# VALIDATION TIMELINE

## Overview

Omega v23.6 requires a phased validation approach to establish construct validity, predictive accuracy, and clinical/organizational utility across three domains: couples relationships, organizational teams, and consciousness assessment.

This timeline outlines Phase 0 through Phase 3, with success criteria at each gate.

---

## PHASE 0: TIER 1 PROOF OF CONCEPT (Weeks 1-12)

### Objective
Establish that core Ω metric can be calculated reliably and shows initial correlation with predicted outcomes.

### Sample Size
**n = 30 couples** (or equivalent system pairs)

### Duration
90 days (3 months)

### Participants
- Couples from therapy practices, coaching centers, or online recruiting
- Age: 18-65
- Relationship duration: 6+ months
- English-speaking

### Measurement Points
- **Baseline (Week 0):** Initial assessment
- **Mid (Week 6):** Tracking interval
- **End (Week 12):** Outcome measurement + follow-up

### Core Variables Measured

**Independent Variables (7 Constructs):**
1. Temporal Stability (Tstab) — consistency over 90 days
2. Entropy (Ω) — disorder/unpredictability in interaction
3. Power Asymmetry (PA) — dominance distribution
4. Coherence (Coh) — alignment of expressed values
5. Boundary Integrity (BI) — external pressure response
6. Repair Capacity (RC) — conflict resolution ability
7. Narrative Continuity (NC) — consistent self-story

**Dependent Variable:**
- Outcome: Couple stayed together / broke up (binary)

### Data Collection Methods
- Self-report questionnaires (construct domains)
- Video-recorded 15-min conflict discussion (behavioral coding)
- Weekly check-in surveys (temporal tracking)
- 90-day follow-up: relationship status (stayed/dissolved)

### Analysis

**Primary:**
- Ω score at baseline vs. outcome (correlation, t-test)
- Predictive accuracy: AUC-ROC
- Effect size: Cohen's d

**Secondary:**
- Tstab trajectory (linear regression over 90 days)
- Which constructs best predict outcome

### Success Criteria (GATE TO PHASE 1)

✅ **ALL of the following required:**

1. **Construct reliability:** Cronbach's α > 0.70 for each construct
2. **Predictive correlation:** Ω score correlates with outcome, |r| > 0.35
3. **Effect size:** Cohen's d > 0.50 (medium effect)
4. **Completion rate:** >85% of participants complete all measurement points
5. **No major adverse events** (no participant harm reported)

**If criteria NOT met:** Return to framework refinement, increase sample, retest Phase 0.

**If criteria met:** → Proceed to Phase 1

---

## PHASE 1: TIER 2 VALIDATION STUDY (Weeks 13-52)

### Objective
Replicate Phase 0 findings in larger, more diverse sample. Establish predictive validity and domain generalization (couples + organizations + consciousness).

### Sample Size

**Track A - Couples:** n = 150  
**Track B - Organizations:** n = 75 teams (5-12 people per team)  
**Track C - Consciousness:** n = 50 patients (coma/anesthesia recovery)

**Total: n = 275 system units**

### Duration
12 months (1 year)

### Recruitment

**Track A (Couples):**
- Couples therapy clinics (10-15 locations)
- Relationship coaching practices
- Online platforms (Craigslist, Facebook groups)
- Diversity: income, ethnicity, age, relationship type (married, cohabiting, long-distance)

**Track B (Organizations):**
- Small businesses (5-20 employees)
- Nonprofit teams
- Corporate departments
- Diversity: industry, team size, crisis vs. stable

**Track C (Consciousness):**
- ICU/hospital partnerships
- Patients in reversible coma/anesthesia
- Recovery monitoring

### Measurement Points

**All tracks:**
- Baseline
- 3-month
- 6-month
- 12-month (outcome)

**Track C additional:**
- Weekly assessments during recovery window

### Core Variables

**Same 7 constructs + expanded outcomes:**

**Couples outcomes:**
- Relationship status (together/dissolved)
- Satisfaction score (DAS scale)
- Therapy completion

**Organizations outcomes:**
- Team stability (turnover: members who left vs. stayed)
- Performance metrics (productivity, retention)
- Crisis events (conflicts, departures)

**Consciousness outcomes:**
- Recovery probability (awake/not awake)
- Time to recovery (days)
- Functional outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale)

### Analysis

**Primary:**
- Ω prediction accuracy in each domain
- Sensitivity, specificity, AUC-ROC
- Domain generalization: does same Ω threshold work across couples/orgs/consciousness?

**Secondary:**
- Temporal trajectory: does Tstab predict *when* collapse occurs?
- Moderators: age, income, crisis type
- Cost-benefit: early warning value vs. measurement cost

### Success Criteria (GATE TO PHASE 2)

✅ **ALL of the following required:**

1. **Predictive accuracy:** AUC-ROC > 0.70 in all three tracks
2. **Replication:** Effect sizes consistent with Phase 0 (d > 0.45)
3. **Domain generalization:** Ω threshold within 10% across couples/orgs/consciousness
4. **Temporal prediction:** Tstab identifies crisis windows with 60%+ accuracy
5. **Completion rate:** >80% across all tracks
6. **Statistical power:** All effect sizes powered at 0.80 (n sufficient)
7. **Publication:** Phase 1 results publishable in peer-reviewed journal

**If criteria NOT met:** Iterate Phase 1 with refined protocol, return to framework refinement.

**If criteria met:** → Proceed to Phase 2

## PHASE 2: TIER 3 CLINICAL/ORGANIZATIONAL UTILITY (Weeks 53-156)

### Objective
Demonstrate that Ω-based early intervention actually *changes outcomes*. Does knowing Ω score lead to better therapist/manager decisions and better client/team outcomes?

### Study Design
Randomized controlled trial (RCT)

### Sample Size

**Track A (Couples):** n = 200 couples (100 intervention, 100 control)  
**Track B (Organizations):** n = 100 teams (50 intervention, 50 control)  
**Track C (Consciousness):** n = 60 patients (30 intervention, 30 control)

**Total: n = 360**

### Duration
12 months

### Intervention

**Intervention group:**
- Receive Ω baseline score at start
- Therapist/manager gets interpretation guide
- Monthly Ω tracking reports
- Crisis alert system (if Ω drops below threshold)
- Optional coaching: "what to do when Ω drops"

**Control group:**
- Standard care (no Ω feedback)
- Therapist/manager unaware of Ω scores
- Outcome measured at end

### Primary Outcome

**Couples:** Breakup rate (intervention vs. control)  
**Organizations:** Team turnover (intervention vs. control)  
**Consciousness:** Recovery probability (intervention vs. control)

### Analysis

**Primary:**
- Group difference in outcome rates
- Number needed to treat (NNT)
- Cost per prevented breakup/turnover/non-recovery

**Secondary:**
- Fidelity: Did therapists/managers actually use Ω feedback?
- Mediators: What interventions did they apply?
- Moderators: Who benefits most from Ω feedback?

### Success Criteria (GATE TO PHASE 3 / DEPLOYMENT)

✅ **ALL of the following required:**

1. **Efficacy:** Intervention group has significantly better outcomes (p < 0.05)
2. **Effect size:** NNT < 10 (meaningful clinical impact)
3. **Safety:** No adverse effects in intervention group
4. **Fidelity:** >70% of practitioners used Ω feedback appropriately
5. **Completion rate:** >85% follow-up
6. **Cost-effectiveness:** Cost per prevented outcome acceptable for target users
7. **Publication:** Phase 2 RCT publishable in top-tier journal

**If criteria NOT met:** Iterate protocol, modify intervention, conduct Phase 2b.

**If criteria met:** → Proceed to Phase 3 deployment
