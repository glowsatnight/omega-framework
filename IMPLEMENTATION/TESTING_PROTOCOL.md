## PART 3: BASELINE ASSESSMENT

### 3.1 Overview

Baseline assessment takes **90-120 minutes** and measures all 7 constructs.

### 3.2 Assessment Format

**Option A: In-person (recommended)**
- Researcher conducts interview
- Behavioral observation (notes on demeanor, consistency)
- Video-record conflict discussion (if couples/team track)

**Option B: Remote (Zoom acceptable)**
- Video call assessment
- Screen-share for questionnaires
- Video record (with consent) for behavioral coding

**Option C: Self-report only**
- Online survey (30-45 minutes)
- No behavioral observation
- Lower cost, less rich data

### 3.3 Construct Measurement

Below are **core items** for each construct. A full instrument is in the SPECIFICATION documents; these are summary items.

#### CONSTRUCT 1: Temporal Stability (Tstab)

**Definition:** Consistency of behavior/presentation across time and context

**Measurement method:**
- Interview: "Tell me about a typical week. How consistent are your day-to-day patterns?"
- Self-report scale (5-item Likert):
  - "My mood is stable from day to day" (1-5)
  - "My relationships follow predictable patterns" (1-5)
  - "My goals stay the same week to week" (1-5)
  - "I can predict my own behavior" (1-5)
  - "My commitments are consistent" (1-5)
- **Score:** Mean of 5 items (1-5 scale)
- **Interpretation:** Higher = more stable

#### CONSTRUCT 2: Entropy (Ω)

**Definition:** Disorder, unpredictability, and noise in system functioning

**Measurement method:**
- Interview: "How much conflict/disruption do you experience weekly?"
- Self-report scale (5-item Likert):
  - "Conversations feel chaotic/unpredictable" (1-5, reversed)
  - "Decisions get reversed frequently" (1-5, reversed)
  - "I'm surprised by people's reactions" (1-5, reversed)
  - "Plans change at the last minute" (1-5, reversed)
  - "Interaction is smooth/predictable" (1-5)
- **Score:** Mean of 5 items (1-5 scale)
- **Interpretation:** Higher = more entropy/disorder

#### CONSTRUCT 3: Power Asymmetry (PA)

**Definition:** Unequal distribution of influence/decision-making power

**Measurement method:**
- Interview: "Who makes most decisions? How is power distributed?"
- Self-report scale (5-item Likert):
  - "One person dominates decisions" (1-5)
  - "Power is balanced" (1-5, reversed)
  - "Some voices get heard more than others" (1-5)
  - "Decision-making is fair" (1-5, reversed)
  - "I have equal say in major decisions" (1-5, reversed)
- **Score:** Highest minus lowest rating (0-4 asymmetry index)
- **Interpretation:** Higher = more asymmetry

#### CONSTRUCT 4: Coherence (Coh)

**Definition:** Alignment between stated values and actual behavior

**Measurement method:**
- Interview: "What do you value most? How well does your life reflect those values?"
- Self-report scale (5-item Likert):
  - "My actions match my values" (1-5)
  - "I do what I say I believe in" (1-5)
  - "My words and actions are consistent" (1-5)
  - "People know what I stand for" (1-5)
  - "I live authentically" (1-5)
- **Score:** Mean of 5 items (1-5 scale)
- **Interpretation:** Higher = more coherent

#### CONSTRUCT 5: Boundary Integrity (BI)

**Definition:** Resilience to external pressure/intrusion

**Measurement method:**
- Interview: "How do you respond to outside pressure/criticism? Do you stay true to yourself?"
- Self-report scale (5-item Likert):
  - "I'm easily influenced by others' opinions" (1-5, reversed)
  - "I stand firm in my decisions" (1-5)
  - "Outside pressure doesn't change my core" (1-5)
  - "I'm resistant to manipulation" (1-5)
  - "I maintain my values under stress" (1-5)
- **Score:** Mean of 5 items (1-5 scale)
- **Interpretation:** Higher = stronger boundaries

#### CONSTRUCT 6: Repair Capacity (RC)

**Definition:** Ability to address conflict and recover from disruption

**Measurement method:**
- Interview: "Tell me about a recent conflict. How did you resolve it?"
- Behavioral task (if couples/team): 15-minute conflict discussion, coded for:
  - Repair attempts (acknowledging issue, softening, apology)
  - Defensiveness (blame, stonewalling)
  - Resolution (problem solved, truce agreed, understanding reached)
- Self-report scale (5-item Likert):
  - "We recover quickly from conflict" (1-5)
  - "We can talk through disagreements" (1-5)
  - "After a fight, we reconnect" (1-5)
  - "We learn from our conflicts" (1-5)
  - "Conflict strengthens our relationship" (1-5)
- **Score:** Mean of 5 items + behavioral coding (blended)
- **Interpretation:** Higher = stronger repair capacity

#### CONSTRUCT 7: Narrative Continuity (NC)

**Definition:** Consistent self-story and identity over time

**Measurement method:**
- Interview: "Tell me the story of your life. Are key themes consistent?"
- Self-report scale (5-item Likert):
  - "My life story makes sense" (1-5)
  - "My past explains who I am now" (1-5)
  - "My identity is stable" (1-5)
  - "I know who I am" (1-5)
  - "My values have been consistent" (1-5)
- **Score:** Mean of 5 items (1-5 scale)
- **Interpretation:** Higher = more narrative continuity

### 3.4 Baseline Assessment Form

**Print or use online survey tool (Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey, Google Forms)**

Combine all 35 self-report items (5 per construct) into single baseline questionnaire. Include demographics:
- Age, gender, relationship status
- Education, income
- Previous therapy/coaching experience
- Current stressors

### 3.5 Video Recording (Couples/Team Track)

If couples or organizational team:

**Conflict discussion protocol:**

1. **Setup:** Camera focused on both people, audio clear
2. **Prompt:** "Discuss a current disagreement/tension. You have 15 minutes. Try to reach understanding."
3. **Recording:** Record entire 15 minutes
4. **Coding:** Later, code for:
   - Repair attempts
   - Defensiveness/stonewalling
   - Resolution attempts
   - Emotional tone (warm, hostile, neutral)

---

## PART 4: TEMPORAL TRACKING

### 4.1 Tracking Schedule

**During intervention period (e.g., 90 days), measure constructs at:**

- **Week 0:** Baseline (above)
- **Week 4:** Brief check-in
- **Week 8:** Mid-study assessment
- **Week 12:** Final assessment + outcome measurement

### 4.2 Brief Check-In (Week 4)

**10-15 minute phone/Zoom call**

- "How have things been since we last talked?"
- Tstab: "Has anything disrupted your normal patterns?"
- Entropy: "More or less chaos?"
- Repair: "Any conflicts? How did you resolve?"
- Overall: "Any major changes coming?"

**Document in notes**

### 4.3 Mid-Study Assessment (Week 8)

**30 minutes**

- Re-administer core self-report items (7 constructs)
- Track changes from baseline
- Identify any crises/major events
- Reassess behavioral observations

### 4.4 Temporal Trend Calculation

**Calculate Tstab trajectory:**

Plot each construct score over time (baseline → week 4 → week 8 → week 12):

```
Tstab score:  4.2 (baseline) → 4.0 (week 4) → 3.8 (week 8) → 3.5 (week 12)

Trend: Declining stability (negative slope = increasing risk)
```

**Interpret:**
- Steep decline = increased collapse risk
- Stable or increasing = resilience

---

## PART 5: OUTCOME MEASUREMENT

### 5.1 Outcome Definition

**Choose outcome appropriate for your track:**

**Couples:**
- **Primary:** Breakup (couple dissolved) vs. stayed together
- **Secondary:** Satisfaction score (DAS), therapy completion

**Organizations:**
- **Primary:** Team stability (turnover: members left vs. stayed)
- **Secondary:** Performance, conflict severity

**Consciousness:**
- **Primary:** Recovery status (awake/aware vs. not)
- **Secondary:** Time to recovery, functional outcome (GOS)

### 5.2 Outcome Assessment (Week 12)

**Phone call, email, or in-person follow-up:**

**Couples:**
- "Are you still together?" (Yes/No)
- "How satisfied are you?" (1-10)
- "Are you in therapy? Did you complete it?" (Yes/No)

**Organizations:**
- "Are you still employed here?" (Yes/No)
- "Is your team still intact?" (same members yes/no)
- "Any major conflicts/resignations?" (describe)

**Consciousness:**
- Review medical records
- "Is patient awake/responsive?" (Yes/No)
- "Time since coma onset to first sign of awareness?" (days)
- "GCS/CRS-R score today?"

### 5.3 Outcome Data Sheet

Create spreadsheet with columns:
- Participant ID
- Baseline Ω score
- Week 12 Ω score
- Tstab trajectory (improving/stable/declining)
- Outcome (success/failure)
- Notes

---

## PART 6: DATA ANALYSIS

### 6.1 Data Preparation

1. **Data entry:** Transcribe all scores into spreadsheet (Excel, R, Python)
2. **Data cleaning:**
   - Check for missing values
   - Verify all scores within range (1-5)
   - Calculate mean scores per construct
   - Flag outliers or inconsistencies
3. **Calculate Ω score:** Use formula from SPECIFICATION
   - Ω = (Entropy × Power Asymmetry) / (Coherence × Repair Capacity × Boundary Integrity × Narrative Continuity)
   - Multiply by Tstab weight: Ω_weighted = Ω × (Tstab / 5)

### 6.2 Descriptive Statistics

**Report for your sample:**

- Age, gender, demographics (mean ± SD, %)
- Baseline construct scores (mean ± SD per construct)
- Baseline Ω distribution (range, median, IQR)
- Outcome rates (% stayed together, % recovered, % team intact)

### 6.3 Primary Analysis: Predictive Validity

**Correlation (if continuous outcome available):**

```
r = correlation(Ω_baseline, outcome_score)

Interpret: r > 0.30 = weak, r > 0.50 = moderate, r > 0.70 = strong
```

**T-test (if binary outcome: success vs. failure):**

```
t = (mean_Ω_success - mean_Ω_failure) / sqrt(SE)

If p < 0.05: statistically significant difference
Cohen's d = effect size (d > 0.50 = medium effect)
```

**Logistic Regression (if predicting binary outcome):**

```
logit(outcome) = β0 + β1(Ω) + β2(Tstab) + ...

Report: odds ratio, 95% CI, p-value
AUC-ROC = area under receiver-operator curve (0.50 = chance, 1.0 = perfect)
```

### 6.4 Secondary Analysis: Temporal Trajectory

**Does Tstab decline predict outcome?**

```
Calculate slope of Tstab over 12 weeks (linear regression)

Positive slope (increasing Tstab) = better outcome
Negative slope (declining Tstab) = worse outcome (collapse)
```

**Sensitivity/specificity:**

Define Ω threshold (e.g., Ω > 2.5 = "high collapse risk"):
- Sensitivity: % of failures correctly identified
- Specificity: % of successes correctly identified
- Goal: Both > 70%
